	   </h3>

		<p>

          Occasionally, our investigations of WGS databases turn up sequences that do not derive from
          endogenous parvoviral elements (EPVs), but instead from infectious viruses
          that have contaminated genomic DNA samples.
          
 
		</p>

         

		<p>
  
          In 2017 we reported sequences derived from viruses belonging to genus <i>Chaphamaparvovirus</i>
          in WGS data of vertebrate species.
          Detection and analysis of these sequences indicated that the host range of
          'chappaparvoviruses' (as the group was then known) encompassed a diverse range of
          vertebrate species.

		</p>

           
        <p>
          Chaphamaparvoviruses are representatives of a newly described parvovirus subfamily: ''<i>Hamaparvovirinae</i>'.
          Although relatively little is known about these viruses (most have only been described at sequence-level) 
          it is becoming clear that they are very widely distributed, and that some are associated with disease.
          For example, porcine parvovirus 7 (PPV) is one of the organisms associated with 
          Stillbirths Mummification Embryonic Death and Infertility (SMEDI) syndrome, while
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/jax-blog/2019/august/mouse-kidney-parvovirus">mouse kidney parvovirus</a>
          is associated with “inclusion body nephritis/nephropathy” - a disease of immunocompromised laboratory mice.

          enREP is one of several dependoparvovirus-derived sequences we identified in the
          Cavia germline. Since many of these elements span different genomic regions,
          it is likely that they derive from a smaller number of initial integrants,
          including at least one genome-length or near genome-length sequence, which
          latterly became fragmented (e.g. by transposable element insertions, chromosome
          re-arrangements). We identified two groups of elements that spanned the rep gene.
          The first includes enRep sequences from both guinea pig species examined.
          The second includes a longer element that spans an entire rep gene. This second
          group of elements is much older, being shared across rodents species that
          diverged >70 million years ago.
          
        </p>

		<p>
          While most of this EPV sequence is degraded, the portions included in the
          enRep-Myo9 gene are intact in multiple species of guinea pig (genus Cavia),
          consistent with evolution under purifying selection.
        </p>

 
		<p>
          The broad expression of enRep-Myo9 mRNA, the conservation of it’s EPV-derived
          regions in multiple species of guinea pig (genus Cavia), indicate that this
          host-virus fusion gene encodes a protein with a physiologically relevant role.
        </p>

          
		<p>
          The viral portions of enRep-Myo9 derive from an ancient dependoparvovirus
          (genus Dependoparvovirus)  that was incorporated into the genome of caviomorph
          rodents >6 million years ago.

          The newly defined subfamily Hamaparvovirinae contains two genera known
          to infect vertebrates. Genus Chaphamaparvovirus contains mouse kidney parvovirus,
          a pathogen of laboratory mice, and viruses identified via sequencing of diverse vertebrate species
          {Genus Ichthamaparvovirus contains a single species, Syngnathus scovelli chapparvovirus,

           <i>Ichthamaparvovirus</i> is a recently discovered genus subfamily <i>Hamaparvovirinae</i>.
           EPVs derived from this genus are rare, but have been detected in

           Amdo.1.Ellobius is an amdoparvovirus-derived EPV, identified in the genome of
           the Transcaucasian mole vole (<i>E. lutescens</i>) 
           - a species of cricetid rodent
           inhabiting semi-arid or grassland areas in Central Asia, and notable for
           its unusual karyotype: only a single sex chromosome is present - with the Y chromosome having been
           eliminated - and all individuals possess a diploid number of 17
           chromosomes.
           This interesting characteristic has motivated the sequencing of the <i>E.lutescens</i>
           genome, as well as that of a sister species - the northern mole vole
           (<i>E. talpinus</i>).
         </p>

          
 
		<p>
           We identified the corresponding empty genomic integration sites
           in E. talpinus - indicating that both elements were incorporated into the
           E.lutescens germline within the last 10 million years.
           Intriguingly, in silico pedictions indicated that this replicase could be
           expressed as a fusion protein with a partial MAFG gene product.

		<p>
           We identified four further EPV in mammal and reptile genomes that are intermediate
           between amdoparvoviruses and their sister genus (Protoparvovirus) in terms of
           their phylogenetic placement and genomic features. In particular, we identify
           a genome-length EPV in the genome of a pit viper (Protobothrops mucrosquamatus)
           that is more like a protoparvovirus than an amdoparvovirus in terms of its
           phylogenetic placement and the structural features of its capsid protein (as
           revealed by homology modeling), yet exhibits characteristically amdoparvovirus-like
           genome features including: (i) a putative middle ORF gene; (ii) a capsid gene
           that lacks a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) domain; (iii) a genome structure consistent
           with an amdoparvovirus-like mechanism of capsid gene expression.
           The AP-derived sequences in the pit vipers also encode a replicase gene that
           appears to have the potential to express intact protein.
