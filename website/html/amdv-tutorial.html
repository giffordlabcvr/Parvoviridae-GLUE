	   <p>
        Humans have established relatively close relationships with several carnivore species.
        But whereas some are kept as companion animals, others are hunted or farmed for meat or fur.
        In Europe, several 
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelidae">mustelid</a>      
        species have historically been hunted for fur, including
        European mink (<i>Mustela lutreola</i>),
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_with_an_Ermine">ermine</a>      
        (<i>Mustela ermina</i>)
        and European polecat (<i>Mustela putorius</i>).
        However, the fur of the    
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Neovison_vison/">North American mink </a>      
        (<i>Neovison vison</i>) is considered
        superior in quality to all of these.
 	   </p>

	   <p>
         Furthermore, while records of efforts to breed ermine (stoats) in captivity exist,
         these ventures have apparently been short-lived. By contrast, North American mink
         are extensively farmed. 
         The first mink farms were founded in the 1860s, in Upstate New York, and farming
         of American mink was introduced into Europe in the early 1930s. The breeding of
         various fur colour mutants led to a boom in the mink industry in the two decades
         that followed.  
 	   </p>

	   <p>
         One unintended consequence of the post-war boom in mink farming was the
         introduction of American mink into Europe (as escaped animals took up residence
         in local habitats). American mink (hereafter referred to simply as ‘mink’)
         are now a relatively widespread invasive species in Europe.         
 	   </p>

	   <p>

         In the 1930s a severe disease emerged in farmed mink. This disease was
         originally identified in the Aleutian mink breed and was consequently named
         <b>Aleutian disease (AD)</b>. However, it was soon discovered to afflict American mink
         in general.
         AD is caused by an parvovirus in genus (<i>Amdoparvovirus</i>)
         called <b>Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV)</b>. This virus was originally considered
         a species in its own right, but has recently been reclassified as a sublineage of
         carnivore amdoparvovirus 1.
      
         AD is presently considered the most important infectious disease
         affecting farm-raised mink.

	   </h3>
       <hr>
		 
	   <p>
         Infection with AMDV - or related amdoparvoviruses -
         is apparently widespread in wild mink as well as in farmed
         animals. In addition, related viruses have been identified in several other carnivore
         species, including gray foxes, skunks, raccoon dogs and red pandas. However,
         relatively little is known about the biology of amdoparvovirus infection in the
         natural environment, or the broader distribution of amdoparvovirus infections
         in wild species.
 	   </p>

		   striped skunk (<i>Mephitis mephitis</i>);
		   raccoon dog (<i>Nyctereutes procyonoides</i>);
		   red panda (<i>Ailurus fulgens</i>);
		 </p>
</blockquote>
		 

         <u>Most importantly</u>, it is not clear whether the pathology of AD in captive mink is
         typical of disease that occurs in the wild, or if factors associated with fur
         farming somehow enabled the emergence of the disease. 
 	   </p>


	   <p>
         Increased availability
         of molecular sequence data mean it might now be feasible to gain some insight
         into the natural history and evolution of amdoparvoviruses, and this in turn
         may shed light on the emergence of AD.
 	   </p>


	   <p>
         In this tutorial we will use the <b>Parvovirus-GLUE</b> project
         and published parvovirus sequence data to <b>(i)</b>
         investigate AMDV distribution diversity and evolution, and <b>(ii)</b> establish
         a sequence-based resource for AMDV.

	   </h3>
       <hr>



	   <p>
         To download all AMDV entries in NCBI GenBank, we 
         will use a customised version of GLUE's 'ncbiImporter'
         <!-- <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/moduleReference/moduleType/ncbiImporter">'<b>ncbiImporter</b>'</a> -->      
         module. Our project-specific configuration of the module can be viewed
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/blob/master/modules/build/genus/amdo/amdoNcbiImporterExampleAmdv.xml"><b>here</b></a>.
         Viewing the file, you can probably see that it is configured to download sequences
         based on a query phrase:

	   <p>
        <i>"Carnivore amdoparvovirus 1"[Organism] AND 200:2000[SLEN]</i>
 	   </p>


	   <p>        
         This 'eSearchTerm' is a standard NCBI entrez text query that
         specifies all GenBank entries labelled "beak and feather disease" in the
         'Organism' field and between 200-5000 nucleotides (nt) in length.

 	   </p>

	   <p>
         To use the module, first initiate GLUE on the command line as follows: 
         
         
  <pre>

  GLUE></code></pre>


          
         Notice from the first line that I'm in the 'Parvovirus-GLUE' directory when
         I initiate GLUE.
         This means that, by default, it will be my 'working directory' - when I reference
         a file from the GLUE console, I'll need to do so <u>relative to this directory</u>.
 	   </p>

	   <p>
 
         Next, navigate to the 'parvoviridae' project as shown here:
	   </p>

  <pre>
  <code>GLUE> project parvoviridae 
  OK
  Mode path: /project/parvoviridae/</code></pre>

 	   </p>
 
	   <p>
         Now create the module using it's
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/blob/master/modules/build/genus/amdo/amdoNcbiImporterExample.xml"><b> configuration file</b></a>,
         which is contained in the Parvovirus-GLUE project, as shown here:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae/
  GLUE> create module -f modules/build/genus/amdo/amdoNcbiImporterExample.xml
  OK
  (1 Module created) </code></pre>

 	   </p>

 	   <p>
         To run the module, execute the following command in the GLUE shell:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae/
  GLUE> module amdoNcbiImporterExample import</code></pre>

 	   </p>
 	   <p>

         When I ran this command on the 2nd March 2022, I obtained the following output:


  <pre>
  <code>ncbiImporterSummaryResult
  totalMatching: 1777
  present: 0
  surplus: 0
  missing: 1777
  deleted: 0
  downloaded: 1777</code></pre>

         Since the GenBank database is continually expanding, you may find
         that you obtain more sequences than this when running the same 
         command at a later date. Note that next time the module is run, only 
         the missing sequences will be downloaded. 
	   </p>
 
 	   <p>
 	     Now export the sequences to a 'source' directory as follows.
 	   

   <pre>
   <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
   GLUE> export source ncbi-curated-parvo-amdv -p sources/genus/amdo/</code></pre>
		</p>

	   </h3>
       <hr>


	   <p>
         Now that we've downloaded a set of AMDV sequences, we can incorporate them into 
         the Parvovirus-GLUE project.
         Load the sequences as follows:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
  GLUE> import source sources/genus/amdo/ncbi-curated-amdv/</code></pre>
 	   </p>
 
 
	   <p>
         The next step is to incorporate additional, sequence related data.
         To do this it we need to consider the underlying schema of the database
         underlying Parvovirus-GLUE, which is defined in 
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/blob/master/glue/build/core/parvoSchemaExtensions.glue"><b>this file</b></a>.
 	   </p>

 
        <p><img src="../assets/images/schema-extensions.png" alt="DB schema" /></p>


<blockquote>
		 <p>
		   <b>Parvovirus-GLUE schema extensions</b>.  All GLUE projects have a 'sequence' table.
		   In Parvovirus-GLUE we've extended this table to capture taxonomic information as 
		   well as some other sequence-associated data fields. In addition, we've defined 
		   a separate 'isolate' table that is linked to the 'sequence' table via the
		   'sequenceID' field (always unique to every sequence). The isolate table contains
		   information specific to the isolate that the sequence was obtained from - e.g.
		   host species from which the isolate was obtained, isolate name, and spatiotemporal
		   data associated with isolation.

		 </p>
</blockquote>
 
	   <br>

	   <p>
          Before we can import sequence-associated data to the isolate table we need to
          create a link to that table for each sequence we have imported.
          This can be accomplished on a sequence-by-sequence basis using GLUE commands.
          Alternatively, to make the process more efficient, we can use a script.
	   </p>
 	   
	   <p>
		  The script is run as follows:

 <pre>
 <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
 GLUE> run script glue/tutorial/exampleLoadSequenceDataAmdv.js</code></pre>
	  



	   <p>

		 An 
         <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/blob/master/modules/build/core/parvoGenbankXmlPopulator.xml"><b>appropriately configured genbankPopulator module</b></a>   
		 can now be used to extract sequence and isolate information from GenBank files.
		 We can use this module to extract useful isolate-related information 
	     that is embedded in the "notes" section of the GenBank file.
	   </p>

 <pre>
 <code>Mode path: /project/cress
 GLUE> module genbankPopulator populate</code></pre>


	   <p>
		 Inspect data in the isolate table via the command line. This time using a
         <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp"><b>'where clause'</b></a>         
		 to limit the query to Japanese isolates only:

	   </p>


 <pre>
 <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
 Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
 GLUE> list sequence sequenceID isolate_data.isolate isolate_data.country -w "genus = 'Amdoparvovirus'"
 +========================+======================+==========================+

 | MT770848               | -                    | Canada: Labrador         |

 +========================+======================+==========================+</code></pre>		   

	   <p>
		 Executing the query above without a where clause will show that
		 not every sequence has complete information for each field in the isolate
		 table. This is because typically, some GenBank entries for any given virus
		 lack this information.
	   </p>


	   <p>
          All AMDV sequences obviously have the same taxonomic information.
          To input the taxonomic data for each sequence in the main 'sequence' table,
          we can again use a script
		  <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/blob/master/glue/tutorial/exampleLoadSequenceDataAmdv.js"><b>this script</b></a>.
	   </p>
 	  

 
 <pre>
 <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
 GLUE> run script glue/tutorial/exampleLoadIsolateDataAmdv.js</code></pre>




   
		 <p>
		   To create an alignment, first, exit the reference sequence to project level (assuming you are still 
		   in this mode path):
		 </p>

   <pre>
   <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae/reference/REF_Amdo_MASTER_AMDV
   GLUE> project-mode 
   OK
   Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
   GLUE></code></pre>
	   
		 <p>
		   Before we perform the alignment construction, we need to first create 
		   a <b>constrained alignment</b> object and specify which sequences belong in it:

  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
  GLUE> create alignment AL_AMDV -r REF_Amdo_MASTER_AMDV
  OK
  Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
  GLUE> alignment AL_AMDV add member --whereClause "source.name = 'ncbi-curated-parvo-amdv'"
  OK</code></pre>
  
		 </p>


		 <p>
		   Now we can construct the alignment.
		   The Parvovirus-GLUE project contains a 
		   <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/blob/master/modules/build/genus/amdo/parvovirusCompoundAligner.xml"><b>parvovirus-specific configuration file</b></a>
		   for GLUE's  'compoundAligner' module.
  <pre>
  <code>compute alignment AL_AMDV parvovirusCompoundAligner</code></pre>
		 </p>

  

		 <p>
		   Now let's inspect the resulting alignment:
  <pre>
  <code>GLUE> alignment AL_AMDV show statistics</code></pre>

		 </p>

		 <p>
		   Or alternatively, list alignment members, along with their associated data, like this:

  <pre>
  <code>GLUE> alignment AL_AMDV 
  OK
  Mode path: /project/parvoviridae/alignment/AL_AMDV
  GLUE> list member sequence.sequenceID sequence.name sequence.isolate.isolate
  +=====================+===============+====================================+

  | AB182568            | AMDV          | YCC-IN1P                           |
  | AB182569            | AMDV          | YCC-IN2P                           |
  | AB182570            | AMDV          | RRP-JP11P                          |
  | AB182571            | AMDV          | RRP-JP12P                          |
  | AB182572            | AMDV          | BTP-SA11P                          |</code></pre>
  
 		 </p>

		 <p>
		   (only the first few results are shown here)
		 </p>

	   
		 <p>
		   How did I figure out which ones? There are lots of ways to do this 
		   using GLUE. In this case I used a fairly unsophisticated approach 
		   (but one that seemed to work quite well).
		 </p>

	   
		 <p>
		   I naively aligned all AMDV sequences then inspected the alignment
		   in the console. Since we had excluded sequences shorter than 200bp when we
		   downloaded from AMDV sequences GenBank (see above), it was a reasonable guess that any
		   sequences for which the only aligned segments were drastically shorter than
		   this length were in reverse orientation relative to the reference.
		 </p>

	   
		 <p>
		   
		   Additionally, 
		   since orientation of sequences is usually consistent within a study, it
		   wasn't particularly difficult to create a list of sequences suspected to 
		   require reverse complementation. 
		 </p>

	   
		 <p>
		   Refining the alignment - may want to manually adjust and re-import.
		   Note, the structure of the alignments directory - refer to alignment tree.
		   AMDV is a 'tip' alignment'.
		 </p>

   <pre>
   <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae/
   GLUE> import alignment -f alignments/tip/</code></pre>

       <hr>
	   
	   <p>
         In the final step in this tutorial, we will create a set of midpoint-rooted
         tree for each of the two main genes in the AMDV genome.
	   </p>

	   <p>
         First, lets build trees for both VP1 and Rep68. We are going to use GLUE's
          <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/moduleReference/moduleType/raxmlPhylogenyGenerator">'<b>raxmlPhylogenyGenerator</b>'</a>       
         
         
         The entire sequence of commands for creating both trees can be found in
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/blob/master/glue/tutorial/exampleCreateAmdvPhylogenies.glue"><b>this file</b></a>,
		 which is in the Parvovirus-GLUE repo, as follows:
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
  GLUE> run file glue/tutorial/exampleCreateAmdvPhylogenies.glue</code></pre>

		 Before you attempt this, bear in mind that we are about to build a bootstrapped,
		 maximum likelihood tree for thousands of sequences. On my computer it took 
		 over an hour to build trees for both genes.  
		 
	   </p>

	   
		<p>
		  To midpoint-root the trees, we will use GLUE's
		  module. To apply the module to the two trees we've constructed, run
		  <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/blob/master/glue/tutorial/exampleRerootPhylogeny.glue"><b>this file</b></a>
		  as follows:


  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
  GLUE> run file glue/tutorial/exampleRerootPhylogeny.glue</code></pre>

         Note that trees could also be midpoint rooted by importing them into another application
         that offers this functionality. However, it is often convenient to be able to 
         do this within GLUE.
         
		</p>
	 
 	   
		<p>
		  Export annotations for the trees by running
		  <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/blob/master/glue/tutorial/exampleExportAnnotations.glue"><b>this file</b></a>,
		  as follows:


  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /project/parvoviridae
  GLUE> run file glue/tutorial/exampleRerootPhylogeny.glue</code></pre>


		</p>	 
  
  
  
		<p>
		  The finished trees with annotations can be found 
		  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/tree/master/trees/virus-level"><b>here</b></a>.
          One way to view these trees is by using Andrew Rambaut's
		  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases"><b>FigTree</b></a>
		  program.
