# Parvoviridae-EVE

## Description

Parvoviridae-EVE is an open source virus sequence data resource focussed on endogenous parvoviral elements (EPV).

Parvoviridae-EVE is based on [GLUE](http://tools.glue.cvr.ac.uk), an open source, data-centric bioinformatics environment specialised for the analysis of virus sequence data.

We have created a core project - [Parvoviridae-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvoviridae-GLUE) - for analysing parvovirus (family Parvoviridae) sequence data generally, and Parvoviridae-EVE is an extension to this project. Parvoviridae-GLUE contains reference information the parvovirus family, including reference sequences representing all recognised parvovirus species. It also contains alignments, trees, and other auxilliary data.

## What's the point of this resource

EPV sequences provide a unique source of retrospective information about the long-term evolution of parvoviruses.

## Standard nomenclature for EPV loci

This project applies a standard nomenclature to EPV loci, following the model described for ERVs in paper cited below, except using the classifier 'ECV' rather than ERV.
