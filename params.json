  "body": "### **Database-integrated genome-screening (DIGS)**\r\n\r\nMuch of the content of genomes consists of poorly characterised '**dark matter**', such as [transposons](https://www.broadinstitute.org/education/glossary/transposable-elements), [pseudogenes](http://pseudogene.org/background.php), [endogenous viral elements (EVEs)](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001191) and obscure [non-coding DNA elements](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/junk-dna/). These sequences, even when non-functional, contain a wealth of **useful biological information** that can be recovered by using [sequence similarity searches](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sss/) in combination with strategically selected reference data.\r\n\r\nIn **database-integrated genome-screening ([DIGS](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/DIGS-tool/wiki/Overview-of-DIGS))**, the output of sequence similarity search-based genome 'screens' is captured in a [relational database](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/overview/database.html). This facilitates the implementation of automated screens that can be performed on a large scale. In addition, it allows for the interrogation and manipulation of output data using [structured query language (SQL)](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp), and provides all the benefits of a relational database management system (RDBMS) with respect to features such as data recoverability, multi-user support and network access.\r\n\r\n### **The DIGS tool**\r\n\r\nThe [DIGS tool](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/DIGS-tool/wiki) provides a computational framework for implementing DIGS. The tool is written in [PERL](https://www.perl.org/). It uses the [Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to perform sequence similarity searches, and the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) RDBMS to capture results and track progress.\r\n\r\nInstructions for installing and running the DIGS tool can be found on [these pages](https://github.com/robjgiff/DIGS-tool/wiki/Installation-and-Setup)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nRobert J.
