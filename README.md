Welcome to **Parvovirus-GLUE**, a resource for comparative genomic analysis of parvoviruses, developed using the [GLUE software framework](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools).

**Parvoviruses** (family *Parvoviridae*) are a diverse group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect a broad range of animal species. This family includes several pathogens of humans and domesticated animals, as well as viruses being developed for therapeutic uses.

**[GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools)** is an open, integrated software toolkit designed for storing and interpreting sequence data. It supports the creation of bespoke projects, incorporating essential data items for comparative genomic analysis, such as sequences, multiple sequence alignments, genome feature annotations, and other associated data.

Projects are loaded into the GLUE "engine," forming a relational database that represents the semantic relationships between data items. This foundation supports systematic comparative analyses and the development of sequence-based resources.

**Parvovirus-GLUE** contains genome feature definitions, multiple sequence alignments, and annotated reference sequences for all parvovirus species included in the [most recent ICTV report](https://ictv.global/report/chapter/parvoviridae/parvoviridae).

This **Parvovirus-GLUE**  project can be extended with additional layers, openly available via GitHub, including **[Parvovirus-GLUE-EVE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE-EVE)**, which extends Parvovirus-GLUE through the incorporation of endogenous parvoviral elements.

Please see the **[User Guide](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/wiki)** for more details.

Installation
------------

To install Parvovirus-GLUE, follow the instructions provided in the **[User Guide](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/wiki)**.

You can choose between:

-   **[Docker-based installation](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/wiki/Docker-Installation)** for ease of deployment.
-   **[Native installation](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Parvovirus-GLUE/wiki/Native-Installation)** for traditional setup.

Parvovirus-GLUE can be installed as a prebuilt database for quick setup or constructed from scratch for more customization.
